## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-14

### Added
- Added the `/agents.md` command to allow the AI to generate an `AGENTS.md` file.
- Implemented automatic context integration for `AGENTS.md`: its content is now automatically included in the conversation context.

### Enhanced
- **Expanded Approval Required functionality**: Added an `[i]nfo` option to view detailed encoding information of AI-generated content. (By Friendev)
- **Improved the `file_replace` tool**:
  - Added `normalize` (fuzzy matching) and `regex` (regular expression) parameters for greater flexibility;
  - Standardized line endings across files to ensure consistent cross-platform handling;
  - Addressed various edge cases to improve robustness.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues related to invalid tool invocations and parameter handling:
  - Strengthened validation to skip malformed tool calls and invalid JSON parameters;
  - Fixed errors caused by missing `tool_response` messages for `tool_call_id`s (e.g., `invalid_parameter_error`: "An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages..."). (By Friendev)

### UX Improvements
- The `/history list` command now automatically filters out sessions with zero messages. (By Friendev)
- On startup, the system now automatically deletes any history files containing zero messages, keeping the session list clean. (By Friendev)
